      2.Project Overview

        Purpose:To verify transactions and can be used for purchases or as an investment.
 
	Features: Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form 
                  of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to 
                  secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating 
                  authority, instead using a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.

      3.Architecture

	Component Structure: chart components are essential in a crypto dashboard. A dashboard 
                             can basically allocate any type of chart. In this tutorial, we will
                             use the DataGrid component, XY series, and Heatmaps.

	State Management: For state management in a cryptocurrency dashboard project, consider using
                          React Context API or Redux for centralized state management to handle data
                          flow and ensure smooth updates across components.

	Routing: Dash or Streamlit for creating the web application, and Plotly for interactive visualizations. 
                 Here's a breakdown of the libraries and their roles:
                 Dash: A framework built on top of Flask, React.js, and Plotly.js for building web
                       applications in Python, especially for data visualization. Dash is suitable for more
                       complex dashboards and applications. 
            Streamlit: Another popular framework for building web apps in Python, especially for data science
                       and machine learning projects. Streamlit is known for its ease of use and simplicity. 
               Plotly: A library for creating interactive and high-quality visualizations in Python, R, 
                       JavaScript, and other languages. It's commonly used with Dash and Streamlit for charting
                       and graphing data.
